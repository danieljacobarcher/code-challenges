# Rails Baseball API
*Estimated time: 4-5 hours*

### Goal
Create an API in a Rails app that tracks baseball scores for a team and players.

#### Level 1
- Create an API in a Rails app. You can use Rails::API, Rails 5.0.0 beta 1, Grape-Ruby API, or roll your own.
- The app should have models for baseball players, their teams, games, and any other models you deem necessary to track scoring.

#### Level 2
- The API should be RESTful to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE data for the models. A user of the API should also be able to:
	- Get top scoring players
	- Get a ranked list of teams
	- Get a list of games with their scores

#### Level 3
- Each player should have a robust "player card". Players should have a photo  and multiple videos associated with their profile.
- An API user should be able to "upload" photo and videos through the API for the player.

#### Level 4
- Player videos should be able to be concatenated together into one long video. For example, if the videos are highlights of them playing in games, the API should be able to return a URL for a single video that shows all video highlights of that player.
