# Ember.js Foursquare App
*Estimated time: 4-5 hours*

### Goal
Create an Ember.js app that makes the Foursquare database of venues searchable and provides analytics. Report on how you could take advantage of Ember for Naritiv.

### Notes before you start
- The Foursquare API Documentation is available [here](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/).
- The UI/UX is totally up to you. It should be intuitive and functional.
- You shouldn't need to create any back-end to support this front-end. If you do, please let me know.
- Each level is designed to build on the previous one - it will get harder, don't feel an obligation to complete all levels. Just complete as much as you feel delivers the product you want to ship.
- When you're done, deploy the app to a free provider (Heroku, etc), and share access to your Github repository with username: 'danieljacobarcher'.

#### Level 1
- Create a simple layout of Foursquare venues with whatever relevant data you think should be displayed for each venue. For example, you may want to show category, location, pricing, menu, likes, checkIns.

#### Level 2
- Add a section (or page) to see overall analytics from venues, in chart and/or map form. This should allow you to filter based on likes, checkIns, and any other values you'd want to filter by.

#### Level 3
- Add an input to filter the list of venues based on location, price, or any other values.
- Add the ability to sort based on distance, price, etc.
- Bonus: Ability to select an area on a map (or use current location and radius) to filter.

**Report:**
- What features could you find useful in implementing into Naritiv Dashboard?
- What features do you think would be a hinderance?
- If a feature would be better done in another framework (React, etc), why?
