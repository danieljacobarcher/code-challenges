# Ember.js Twitter App
*Estimated time: 4-5 hours*

### Goal
Create an Ember.js app that clones Twitter and report on how you could take advantage of Ember for Naritiv.

#### Level 1
- Create a simple Twitter feed that displays tweets from accounts you follow, including likes and retweets.
- A user should be able to like or retweet tweets.
- The app should use Twitter Oauth for login.

#### Level 2
- The app should automatically update the amount of likes/retweets on the front-end, as they are updated on Twitter. (If this is not possible, please report why)

#### Level 3
- Add a section for a user's Twitter profile. The user should be able to update their name, avatar, and cover photo for Twitter.

#### Level 4
- Add a page that allows the user to track a hashtag from Twitter. It should show how many likes and retweets that hashtag has, and show the top tweets using that hashtag.

**Report:**
- What features could you find useful in implementing into Naritiv Dashboard?
- What features do you think would be a hinderance?
- If a feature would be better done in another framework (React, etc), why?
- How do you see deploying this app?
- How do you see this app scaling?
- How would you create a build process around a front-end framework like this?
