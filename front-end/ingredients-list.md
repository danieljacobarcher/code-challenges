# Ingredients List
*Estimated time: 3-4 hours*

### Goal
Create a client-side app that lists vitamin ingredients with a detail view. You can use Ember.js, VueJS, or ReactJS

### Notes before you start
- The UI/UX is available in this folder for a desktop layout in both Sketch and PDF formats. You should also make it work gracefully on a mobile screen.
- You shouldn't need to create any back-end to support this front-end. If you feel that you do, please let me know.
- Each level is designed to build on the previous one - it will get harder, don't feel an obligation to complete all levels. Just complete as much as you feel delivers the product you want to ship.
- When you're done, deploy the app to a free provider (Heroku, etc), and share access to your Github repository with username: '@dja'.
- Try not to go over the allotted time :)

#### Level 1
- Create a list of ingredients, with an expanded detail view that shows when clicking an ingredient.

#### Level 2
